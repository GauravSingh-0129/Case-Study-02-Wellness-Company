The UCLA Center for Human Nutrition says that eating fewer than 1,000 calories per day 
has the same effect physiologically as total starvation. 
With that in mind, it makes sense that the USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend a much higher 
calorie level for health.

The bare minimum of sleep needed to live, not just thrive, is 4 hours per 24-hour period.

Take 10,000 steps every day and you will meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the Surgeon General's recommendation to log at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 
most days of the week.

Too much sleep on a regular basis can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, 
and death according to several studies done over the years. Too much is defined as greater 
than nine hours.
The most common cause is not getting enough sleep the night before, or cumulatively during 
the week. This is followed by sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnolence, 
as well as depression.
