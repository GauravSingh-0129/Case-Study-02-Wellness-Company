The UCLA Center for Human Nutrition says that eating fewer than 1,000 calories per day has the same effect physiologically as total starvation. 
With that in mind, any data with less than 1000 calories recorded data is assumed to be invalid else they would starve.

The bare minimum of sleep needed to live, not just thrive, is 4 hours per 24-hour period. So, sleep less than 240 minutes a day is assumed as incomplete logs.

Removed duplicate column "TotalDistance".

Added column "Active Minutes".

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Surgeon General's recommendation, taking 10,000 steps every equals moderate activity most days of the week.

Dr. Robert Rosenberg reseach showed that too much sleep on a regular basis can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, 
and death according to several studies done over the years.
Too much is defined as greater than nine hours. The most common cause is not getting enough sleep the night before, or cumulatively during the week. This is followed by sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnolence, as well as depression.

So anything above 540 minutes is catogerized as excessive sleep.
